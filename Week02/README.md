Did you try one, then switch to the other? Did you decide on “the right one” and stick with
it? What factors influenced your choice?

I had tried the class and switched back to a struct because I was having complications with the init inside of the class.  
I wanted to use the struct for the value types, as I thought that would be more appropriate for this application.

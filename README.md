NAME: Calvin williams

DISCORD USERNAME: calv1n

LOCATION: Tyler, TX USA

PROGRAMMING EXPERIENCE: nil

GOALS: I have a sick enjoyment out of suffering on coding, failing and failing, but the second that works, it sends a huge surge to my brain of ecstatic joy.  If I could do that every day, that would be fantastic.  

INTERESTS:  I enjoy gaming, although I don't get to play near is much as I'd like.  I like to play CS:GO every other Friday, it is a ritual that me and a few buddies have had for ~4 or so years
